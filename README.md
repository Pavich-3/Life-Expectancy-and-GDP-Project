# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Project
I analyzed data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

Components that I want to include:

Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
   - Yes, with Zimbabwe having the greatest increase.
Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
   - GDP has also increased for all countries in our list, especially for China.
Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
    - Yes, there is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy for countries in our list. The Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.34
What is the average life expectancy in these nations?

The average life expectancy in Chile: 78.94.
The average life expectancy in China: 74.26.
The average life expectancy in Germany: 79.66.
The average life expectancy in Mexico: 75.72.
The average life expectancy in the USA: 78.06.
The average life expectancy in the Zimbabwe: 50.09.
The average life expectancy in all the countries: 72.79.

Conclusions

Finally, we can wrap up the project.Â 
Firstly, Zimbabwe having the greatest increased life expectancy over time of the six nations. Added to that, we can say that the highest average life expectancy in Germany.
Secondly, especially for China, the GDP the most increased. But the biggest number of GDP in the USA.
And finally, we have a medium positive Pearson correlation for the relationship of life expectancy with GDP.
